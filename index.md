### Conversational AI for PDF Interaction
This project presents a unique approach to interacting with PDF documents using advanced artificial intelligence. The system allows users to upload a PDF and engage in a conversational format with the document. This is achieved by leveraging the power of the "Instructor-xl" language model from Hugging Face.

The model generates embeddings based on the text within the document, enabling it to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries. This innovative application of AI technology transforms the way users interact with PDFs, making the process more intuitive and efficient.
